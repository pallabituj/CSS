        <h1>Winter Morning</h1>
        <p>Winter morning is a morning of dark, cold, and foggy weather. It normally tends to be bleak and melancholy. There’s a dense fog all around that makes it hard to see anything. Grasses are wet with drops of dew, and when the sun rises, the drops of dew shine like pearls. The sun comes out from behind the clouds and the fog pretty late. Most people wake up from rest late in the morning.</p>

        <P>Old people and children look for ways to be warm on a winter morning. They also lounge around a straw fire and talk to each other to pass the time. They also bask in the sun’s warm rays to escape the cold. The destitute shudder in the cold because they have no comfortable, warm clothes. Even animals huddle together and try to save themselves from the gnawing cold outside.</P>
